# bio:  I have five older brother and have spent my entire life up until now living in South and Central Texas.  My childhood was spent in rural areas while as an adult I lived in the more urban area of Austin, TX.  Seeing how these changes in human density influenced the environment in which I lived played a big role in directing my educational trajectory.

# expectations: learn more about analyzing diversity, use GitHub, better knowldge of R
