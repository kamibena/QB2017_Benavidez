## OVERVIEW

In this Assignment, we extend our understanding of diversity from the spatial dimension to the temporal dimension. 

After completing this exercise you will know how to:

1. wrangle a large dataset to visualize and analyze time series data
2. test hypotheses from experiments with temporal data
3. quantify temporal $\beta$-diversity and stability

## Directions:
1. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
2. Complete as much of the exercise as possible during class; what you do not complete in class will need to be done on your own outside of class.
3. Use the Handout as a guide; it contains a more complete description of data sets along with the proper scripting needed to carry out the exercise.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this exercise document; they also correspond to the Handout.
Space for your answer is provided in this document and indicated by the ">" character.
If you need a second paragraph be sure to start the first line with ">".
5. Before you leave the classroom, **push** this file to your GitHub repo.
6. When you are done with the Assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a html file.
7. After Knitting, please submit the completed Assignment by creating a **pull request** via GitHub.
Your pull request should include this file *temporal_assignment.Rmd* and the html output of `Knitr` (*temporal_assignment.html*).

## 1) R SETUP

Typically, the first thing you will do in either an R script or an RMarkdown file is setup your environment. 
This includes things such as setting the working directory and loading any packages that you will need.

In the R code chunk below, provide the code to:  

1. clear your R environment,
2. print your current working directory,
3. set your working directory to your "*/Week5-Temporal*" folder, and 
4. load any packages you need to complete the assignment.

```{r}

rm(list=ls())
getwd() 
setwd("~/GitHub/QB2017_Benavidez/Week5-Temporal/")

package.list <- c('vegan', 'tidyr', 'dplyr', 'codyn', 'ggplot2',
                  'cowplot', 'MullerPlot', 'RColorBrewer',
                  'reshape2', 'lubridate',
                  'TTR', 'xtable', 'multcomp', 'pander', 'png',
                  'grid', 'tseries', 'nlme', 'forecast', 'lsmeans')
for (package in package.list) {
  if (!require(package, character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(package, repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
    library(package, character.only = TRUE) 
    }
}
```

## 2) LOADING DATA
### Load dataset
In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. load the `portal` dataset from in the "*/Week5/data*" folder, and
2. explore the structure of the dataset.

```{r}
portal <- read.table("data/combined.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
summary(portal)
```

***Question 1***:  Describe some of the attributes of the `portal` dataset.  

a.  How many plots are in `portal`?
b.  How many rodent species are there in the `portal` dataset?

> ***Answer 1a***:  24 plots are present  
> ***Answer 1b***:  After discounting lizards and birds, 29 species of rodents are present - five of these are entered as 'sp' (i.e. Dipodomys sp.), so there is a possibility there are more.

## 3) WRANGLING THE PORTAL DATASET

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. Create a site-by-species matrix for any year of your choosing.
2. Create a vector of plot_type for sites in the site-by-species matrix.
3. Analyze alpha diversity (e.g., Shannon/Simpson) across the sites for that year.
4. Create a PCoA ordination of your site-by-species matrix.
5. Using the hypothesis testing tools you learned in the beta-diversity module, test the hypothesis that species abundances across sites vary as a factor of treatment type (i.e., plot_type). 

```{r}
portal <- unite(portal, col = date, c(year, month, day), sep = "-", remove = FALSE)
portal <- unite(portal, col = taxon, c(genus, species), sep = "_", remove = FALSE)

time.by.species <- group_by(portal,year,plot_id) %>%
  count(taxon) %>% spread(key=taxon,value=n,fill=0)

dplyr::filter(time.by.species,year==1984)
dplyr::filter(time.by.species,plot_id==5)

tbs.1981 <- group_by(portal,year,plot_id) %>%
  count(taxon) %>% spread(key=taxon,value=n,fill=0)

time.by.species.1981 <- as.data.frame(tbs.1981[93:116,])
tbs1981=time.by.species.1981[,3:50]

diversity(tbs1981,"simp")

tbs1981.db=vegdist(tbs1981,method="bray")

rodent.pcoa=cmdscale(tbs1981.db,eig=T, k=3)
explainvar1=round(rodent.pcoa$eig[1] / sum(rodent.pcoa$eig), 3) * 100
explainvar2=round(rodent.pcoa$eig[2] / sum(rodent.pcoa$eig), 3) * 100
explainvar3=round(rodent.pcoa$eig[3] / sum(rodent.pcoa$eig), 3) * 100
sum.eig=sum(explainvar1,explainvar2,explainvar3)

par(mar = c(5, 5, 1, 2) + 0.1)
plot(rodent.pcoa$points[ ,1], rodent.pcoa$points[ ,2], ylim = c(-0.2, 0.7),
    xlab = paste("PCoA 1 (", explainvar1, "%)", sep = ""),
    ylab = paste("PCoA 2 (", explainvar2, "%)", sep = ""),
    pch = 16, cex = 2.0, type = "n", cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.2, axes = FALSE)
axis(side = 1, labels = T, lwd.ticks = 2, cex.axis = 1.2, las = 1) 
axis(side = 2, labels = T, lwd.ticks = 2, cex.axis = 1.2, las = 1) 
abline(h = 0, v = 0, lty = 3)
box(lwd = 2)
points(rodent.pcoa$points[ ,1], rodent.pcoa$points[ ,2], 
       pch = 19, cex = 3, bg = "gray", col = "gray")
text(rodent.pcoa$points[ ,1], rodent.pcoa$points[ ,2], 
     labels = row.names(rodent.pcoa$points))

rodentREL=rodent

  for(i in 1:nrow(rodent)){
    rodentREL[i, ] = rodent[i, ] / sum(rodent[i, ]) 
  }
rodent.pcoa=add.spec.scores(rodent.pcoa,rodentREL,method = "pcoa.scores") 
text(rodent.pcoa$cproj[ ,1], rodent.pcoa$cproj[ ,2],
     labels = row.names(rodent.pcoa$cproj), col = "black")

```

***Question 2***: Describe how different biodiversity estimates vary among sites.

a. Does diversity vary among sites? Does this correspond to treatment type?
b. Is treatment type a significant predictor of site dissimilarity?

> ***Answer 2a***: 
> ***Answer 2b***:

## 4) TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. Create a time-by-species matrix that includes year, month, and plot_id for a site other than plot_id 2.
2. Examine per-hectare rodent abundance using simple moving average smoothing.
3. Test whether your data meets the assumption of stationarity.
4. If it does not meet this asumption, explore wasy to make your data stationary.
5. Examine and plot time lags using the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) and autocorrelation function (ACR).
6. Use the tools outlined in the Handout to create an ARMA model.

```{r}
time.by.spec.2 <- filter(portal, taxa=="Rodent") %>%
  group_by(year,month, plot_id) %>%
  count(taxon)

time.by.spec.2$season <- NA
time.by.spec.2$season <- time.by.spec.2$month %in% c(6:10)

time.by.spec.2$season <- ifelse(time.by.spec.2$season == TRUE, "rain", "norain")

group_by(time.by.spec.2, year, season)

abund <- filter(time.by.spec.2, plot_id == 3) %>% 
  group_by(year, season) %>%
  count(wt = n)

abund$nn <- abund$nn * 4

abund.ts <- ts(abund$nn, frequency = 2, start = c(1977, 2))

plot.ts(abund.ts, type = "l", ylab = "Rodent Abundance(#/hectare)",
        xlab = "Time (year)", las = 1, ylim = c(0, 500))


#smoothing
abund.sm <- SMA(abund$nn, n = 5)

plot(abund.sm, type = "l", col = "red", ylab = "Rodent Abundance (#/hectare)",
     xlab = "Sample", las = 1, ylim = c(0, 500))

lines(abund$nn, col = "black")

legend(0, 475, col = c("red", "black"), lty = c(1,1),
       c("smooth", "non-smooth"), bty = "n", cex = 1)

#exponential smoothing
abund.hw <- HoltWinters(abund$nn, beta = FALSE, gamma = FALSE)

plot(abund.hw, xlab = "Time (year)", ylim = c(0, 500),
     ylab = "Rodent Abundance (#/hectrare)", las = 1, main = NA)

legend(0, 475, col = c("black", "red"), lty = c(1,1),
       c("non-smooth", "smooth"), bty = "n", cex = 1)

#decomposition
abund.comp <- decompose(abund.ts)
plot(abund.comp)

abund.adj <- abund.ts - abund.comp$seasonal

#stationarity

adf.raw <- adf.test(abund.ts, alternative = "stationary")
adf.raw$p.value

abund.ts.diff <- diff(abund.ts)
adf.diff <- adf.test(abund.ts.diff, alternative = "stationary")
adf.diff$p.value

#pacf and acf
acf(abund.ts)

pacf(abund.ts)

#arma
abund.arm <- auto.arima(abund.ts)
abund.arm <- arima((abund.ts), c(0, 0, 1), seasonal = list(order = c(2, 1, 0),
                                                           period = 2), include.mean =
                     TRUE)


tsdiag(abund.arm)


pred.arm <- predict(abund.arm, n.ahead = 20)
ts.plot(abund.ts, pred.arm$pred, lty = c(1,3))

```

***Question 3***: Describe the results from your time series analysis.

a. Does your data meet the assumption of stationarity? If not, what does this violation imply?
b. What does the ACF function do and how does it relate to the ARMA model? How does this differ from the autocorrelation function (ACF)?
c. What results can you conclude from your full ARMA model along with other methods outlined in the time series setcion of the Handout?

## 5) REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (RM-ANOVA)
In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. Create an appropriate data frame for RM-ANOVA (e.g., yearly species abundance values within plots).
2. Calculate the inverse of Simpson's diversity for each year, and plot it as a function of year for the Control and Rodent Exclosure plots.
3. Perform an RM-ANOVA and construct a F-test using the AR(1), compound symmetery, and unstructured covariance structures.

```{r}

##Wrangling data
# time-by-species matrix
time.by.species <- group_by(portal, year, plot_id,
                            plot_type) %>% count(taxon) %>% spread(key = taxon, value = n,
                                                                   fill = 0)

# observed richness from time-by-species matrix
richness <- as.data.frame(rowSums(time.by.species[,-c(1:3)] > 0))

# data frame with experimental design and richness data
rich.all <- data.frame(time.by.species[,1:3,], richness)

# Rename column
names(rich.all)[4] <- "richness"


# Pull out two of the five Portal treatments
rich.treat <- rich.all[which(rich.all$plot_type ==
                               "Control" | rich.all$plot_type == "Rodent Exclosure"), ]

##Plotting data
rich.treat.plot <- group_by(rich.treat, plot_type, year) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(richness), 
    sd = sd(richness), 
    n = n(), 
    sem = sd/sqrt(n)) 

rich.plot <- ggplot(rich.treat.plot, aes(x = year, y = mean, color = plot_type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, show.legend = T) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sem, ymax = mean + sem), width = .1) +
  xlim(1977, 2002) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Richness")+
  scale_color_grey()

plot(rich.plot)

rich.rm <- lme(richness ~ plot_type * year, random = ~ 1 | plot_id,
               correlation = corAR1(form = ~ 1 | plot_id),
               data = rich.treat)
summary(rich.rm)
anova(rich.rm)

set.caption("RMANOVA for Portal")
pander(anova(rich.rm))

lsmeans(rich.rm, ~plot_type)
```

1. Calculate species abundances for each taxonomic group (the `taxa` column).
2. Calculate total turnover and turnover due to the gain/loss of species for each group.
3. Visualize turnover within each group

```{r}
portal.species.abunds <- group_by(portal, year, plot_type) %>% count(taxon)

portal.total <- turnover(df = portal.species.abunds,
                         time.var = "year",

                         abundance.var = "n",
                         replicate.var = "plot_type",
                         metric = "total")

portal.appearance <- turnover(df = portal.species.abunds,
                              time.var = "year",
                              species.var = "taxon",
                              abundance.var = "n",
                              replicate.var = "plot_type",
                              metric = "appearance")

portal.disappearance <- turnover(df = portal.species.abunds,
                                 time.var = "year",
                                 species.var = "taxon",
                                 abundance.var = "n",
                                 replicate.var = "plot_type",
                                 metric = "disappearance")

portal.turnover <- full_join(portal.total, portal.disappearance) %>%
  full_join(portal.appearance)

portal.turnover <- gather(portal.turnover, key = metric, value = turnover,
                          total, appearance, disappearance)

turn.plot <- ggplot(
  portal.turnover, aes(x = year, y = turnover, color = metric)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, show.legend = T) +
  facet_wrap(~plot_type, ncol = 1) +
  xlim(1977, 2002) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Turnover") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_color_grey()

b. Which taxonomic group appears to be the most variable? Which group appears to be the least variable?

### Mean Rank Shift
In the code chunk below, do the following:

1. Choose two plot_types or two plot_ids and compare the mean rank shift (MRS) between them.
2. Plot MRS for each through time. 

```{r}
portal.abunds.cont.rodent <- filter(portal.species.abunds,
                                    plot_type == "Control" | plot_type == "Rodent
                                    Exclosure")

portal.rankshift <- rank_shift(
  df = as.data.frame(portal.abunds.cont.rodent),
  time.var = "year",
  species.var = "taxon",
  abundance.var = "n",
  replicate.var = "plot_type")

portal.rankshift$year <- as.numeric(substr(portal.rankshift$year_pair, 6, 9))

rankshift.plot <- ggplot(portal.rankshift, aes(x = year, y = MRS, color = plot_type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  xlim(1977, 2002) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Mean Rank Shift") +
  scale_color_grey()

plot(rankshift.plot)

group_by(portal.rankshift, plot_type) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(MRS),
    cv = sd(MRS)/mean)
```

### Rate Change Interval
In the R code chunk below, do the following:

1. Calculate the rate change interval using the Hellinger distance.
2. Plot the results.

```{r}

                                       length(portal.species.abunds$n))

portal.hellinger.transf <- portal.species.abunds %>%
  mutate(hellinger.transf = sqrt(n / tot.abund))

portal.change.int <- rate_change_interval(portal.hellinger.transf,
                                          time.var = "year",
                                          species.var = "taxon",

## 7) STABILITY
In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. Using total abundance as your focal variable, calculate stability (i.e., 1/CV) and synchrony for each plot type.
2. Test for a biodiversity-stability relationship by regressing community stability on mean richness. 
3. Test for a biodiversity-stability relationship by regressing community stability on mean inverse Simpson's diversity.

  summary(div.stab.lm)$adj.r.square, digits = 3)))
text(3.25,3.75, cex = 1.5, labels = r2)

```
